Add the Products Quick View to your all of your grid view product listings. Opens full page content - add to cart, view cart, close, keep browsing.

== Description ==

WP e-Commerce Quick View Ultimate gives your customers a true supermarket shopping experience. In a supermarket shoppers browse products on the shelves, picking up the ones they are interested up, reading all the relevant information and either adding the item to their cart or putting it back on the shelf and continuing to browser. You can now give your customer exactly the same experience with Quick View Ultimate.

While browsing products anywhere in your store where you have grid view activated - Product page / category pages / tag pages they see a products that interests them - instead of clicking 'More Details' and going to another page to view all the product information and images they click Quick View and see it all in a pop-up right there on their screen. This is the sequence

* See something of interest - Pick it up from the shelf (Open the product in the pop-up)
* View all the products information and make a buying decision
* Either add the item to the shopping basket (Add to Cart)
* Or put the item back on the shelf and continue to browse (close the pop-up)

It is quick easy and incredibly convenient for your customers and will create more sales.

= Why we built this Plugin =

We wanted our customers to have a true supermarket shopping experience. Other Quick View plugins only enable users to use the cart meta (select options and add to cart) in a pop-up.

= Quick View Features =

* Works on any theme.
* Pop-up opens full page content.
* Fully mobile responsive - if your theme is responsive it opens in its true responsive dimensions within the pop-up.
* Show Quick View as a button or hyperlink text (fully customizable without writing any code)
* All product page features added by plugins work within the pop-up.
* Show Quick View on hover over image or show as button or linked text under the image.
* Fully cross browser compliant including IE9 to IE11.
* Mobile device optimized - all tablets and phones


= Grid View Compatibility =

* Products Quick View works when you have the grid view feature activated in the WP e-Commerce plugin.
* There are 2 plugins that activate Grid View in WP e-Commerce. Our plugin [WP e-Commerce Grid View](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce-grid-view/) and the getshopped.org [Gold Cart plugin](http://getshopped.org/premium-upgrades/premium-plugin/gold-cart-plugin/).
* Products Quick View does not work with list view.

= Featuring Sass (Simply Awesome Stylesheets) =

* All the front end style display is created via [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) #dynamic {stylesheets}.
* Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
* Sass loads and renders much faster in all browers.
* Sass #dynamic {stylesheets} allows you to edit the plugins front end layout and display without touching the code.
* This plugins backend admin panels are created in Sass.

= Hover Button Sass #dynamic Styling =

* Create the perfect Quick View button style to match your site with the point click settings.
* Do it all with Sass #dynamic {stylesheets} from the admin panel with touching the code.
* Change it any time you like.

= Show Quick View under the Image =

* Option to show Quick View as a Button or Hyper linked text under the product image.
* When placed under the image Quick View is visible all of the time.
* Sass #dynamic {stylesheets} Button creator, for creating the perfect style without touching the theme code.
* Sass #dynamic {stylesheets} style transparency setting.
* Sass #dynamic {stylesheets} Hyperlink text creator - Simple point click settings to create an eye catching clickable link.
* Quick View button has 3 Positional settings Top, Center or bottom of the image.

= Mobile Responsive Quick View Pop-up =

* Fancybox pop-up tool - can't be blocked by browser pop-up settings.
* Pop-up opens in 0.300 of a second and closes instantly.
* SEO tracking - Your analytics tracking code e.g. Google records every view.
* Add to Cart, View Cart all work within the pop-up.

= Lite & Pro Version Admin Interface =

* All a3rev Lite Version plugins have exactly the same admin interface as the Pro Version.
* Pro Version features and settings are inside of a Yellow border.
* The Pro Version settings are all active on the admin panels But do not save and are not applied to the front end.
* Upgrading to the Pro version activates all the Pro version Features and Settings and removes the Yellow side bar and borders.

= Lite Version Support =

* As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum.
* We do not watch that forum and posting there you will be relying on another user for support, not an a3rev team member.
* Upgrading to a Pro Version Licence gives 'write' access to the a3rev support forum.
