Add the Products Quick View to your all of your grid view product listings. Opens full page content - add to cart, view cart, close, keep browsing.
  
== Description ==

WP e-Commerce Quick View Ultimate gives your customers a true supermarket shopping experience. In a supermarket shoppers browse products on the shelves, picking up the ones they are interested up, reading all the relevant information and either adding the item to their cart or putting it back on the shelf and continuing to browser. You can now give your customer exactly the same experience with Quick View Ultimate.

While browsing products anywhere in your store where you have grid view activated - Product page / category pages / tag pages they see a products that interests them - instead of clicking 'More Details' and going to another page to view all the product information and images they click Quick View and see it all in a pop-up right there on their screen. This is the sequence

* See something of interest - Pick it up from the shelf (Open the product in the pop-up)
* View all the products information and make a buying decision
* Either add the item to the shopping basket (Add to Cart)
* Or put the item back on the shelf and continue to browse (close the pop-up)

It is quick easy and incredibly convenient for your customers and will create more sales.   

= Why we built this Plugin =

We wanted our customers to have a true supermarket shopping experience. Other Quick View plugins only enable users to use the cart meta (select options and add to cart) in a pop-up.

= Quick View Ultimate Features =

* Works on any theme.
* Pop-up opens full page content.
* Fully mobile responsive - if your theme is responsive it opens in its true responsive dimensions within the pop-up.
* Quick View button shows on mouse over the image.
* Quick View button has 3 Positional settings Top, Center or bottom of the image.
* Fancybox pop-up tool - can't be blocked by browser pop-up settings.
* Pop-up opens in 0.300 of a second and closes instantly.
* SEO tracking - Your analytics tracking code e.g. Google records every view.
* Add to Cart , View Cart all work within the pop-up.
* All product page features add by plugins work within the pop-up. 
* Fully cross browser compliant including IE7 to IE10.
* Mobile device optimized - all tablets and phones

= Grid View Compatibility =

Products Quick View works when you have the grid view feature activated in the WP e-Commerce plugin. There are 2 plugins that activate Grid View in WP e-Commerce. Our plugin [WP e-Commerce Grid View](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce-grid-view/) and the getshopped.org [Gold Cart plugin](http://getshopped.org/premium-upgrades/premium-plugin/gold-cart-plugin/). Products Quick View does not work with list view.

= Mobile Responsive App style admin interface =

Like WordPress we believe that a3rev plugin users should be able to configure and tweak our plugins settings while on the go, right from their mobile or tablet. This plugins features an app style admin interface with Switches, Sliders and a smart interface that hides associated settings when a feature is not turned ON.

* 100% compatible with WordPress v3.8.0 admin interface.
* Backward compatibility to WordPress v3.5.0
* App style admin interface.
* Admin app interface is fully mobile and tablet responsive.

= Lite & Pro Version Admin Interface =

All a3rev Lite Version plugins have exactly the same admin interface as the Pro Version. Pro Version features and settings are easy to spot on the admin dashboard as they are inside of a Yellow border. The Pro Version settings are all active on the admin panels so they can be used to get a great idea of how they work and what is available BUT the settings do not save when changes are saved and hence are not applied to the front end. Upgrading to the Pro version activates all the Pro version Features and Settings and removes the Yellow side bar and borders.

= Lite Version Support =

As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum. We do not watch that forum and posting there you will be relying on another user for support, not an a3rev team member. Upgrading to a Pro Version Licence gives 'write' access to the a3rev support forum and hence Lifetime priority support as part of the License.

= Pro Version Upgrade =

This plugin has a Pro Version upgrade that adds more functionality to this Free version. You will see all of the available upgrade features on the plugins admin panel, in the Yellow sidebar. Those Pro features include:

= Hover Button Advanced Point and Click Styling =

* Create the perfect Quick View button style to match your site with the a3rev point and click style settings.
* Button transparency selector. 
* Do it all by point click from the admin panel with touching the code.
* Change it any time you like.

= Show Quick View under the Image =

* Option to show Quick View as a Button or Hyper linked text under the product image.
* When placed under the image Quick View is visible all of the time and does not rely on the user mousing over or touching the listing to show.
* Advanced Point & Click button creator with transparency setting.
* Point and Click Button creator and Hyperlink text editors - Simple point click settings to create an eye catching button
* Padding settings above and below Button / Link text allow you to style how Quick View is positioned under the image on your theme.

= Advanced Pop-up Controls =

* Option to use Colorbox pop-up tool.
* Set pop-up wide as a % of screen size in larger screens.
* Select pop-up open and close transition effect.
* Set pop-up opening / closing speed.
* Set pop-up background overlay colour with WordPress colour picker.
* Fix pop-up or allow it to scroll with the screen content
* Same day priority Pro License support and auto updates from the a3API.

= Product Page Content Option =

* Option to show Product Page Content instead of opening the page url in the pop-up.

= Priority Support =

Please note that we do not provide support for our Lite Version plugins. Hundreds of thousands of plugin downloads has proven that vast majority of the support requests we get have nothing to do with our plugins but are related to bugs in the users theme or other plugins they have installed. We give priority support to those users who purchase a Pro Version license. In this plugins case, we offer a single payment, Lifetime License fee which includes access to and full support from the a3rev support forum.

= Localization =

* English (default) - always included.
*.po file (wpecquickview.po) in languages folder for translations.
* If you do a translation for your site please send it to us for inclusion in the plugin language folder. We'll acknowledge your work here. [Go here](https://a3rev.com/contact-us-page/) to send your translation files to us.
